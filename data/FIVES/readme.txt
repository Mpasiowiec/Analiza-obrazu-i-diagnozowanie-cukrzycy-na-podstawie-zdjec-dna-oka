FIVES* (800)
FIVES dataset consists of 800 high-resolution multi-disease color fundus photographs with pixel-wise manual annotation. The annotation process was standardized through crowdsourcing of a group of medical experts. The quality of each image was evaluated, including illumination and color distortion, blur, and low contrast distortion, based on which the data splitting was conducted to make sure the balanced distribution of image features.
