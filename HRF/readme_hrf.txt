HRF*(45, wysokiej jakosci dataset)
The public database contains at the moment 15 images of healthy patients, 15 images of patients with diabetic retinopathy and 15 images of glaucomatous patients(deleted in this repository). Binary gold standard vessel segmentation images are available for each image. Also the masks determining field of view (FOV) are provided for particular datasets. The gold standard data is generated by a group of experts working in the field of retinal image analysis and clinicians from the cooperated ophthalmology clinics. We intend to add further gold standard data to the existing images to help the evaluation of algorithms which localize the macula, optic disc, or differentiate between arteries and veins.
